      <p> The first step to being good at mechwarrior is to select the perfect mech. There are about 400 different mechs so I have to seperate them into classes.
       The first class is scout. You should pick a fast, small light mech perferably with TAG or NARC and ECM. Your job is to run around the flanks and harass and spot enemies for missile strikes. Shoot them with a NARC and TAG and use your ECM to stay alive. A good example is the locust with any variant.
       The second class is striker. These are more armored and slower. You should pick a medium or light mech with punch. Your job is to run up to enemy mechs lighter than you and let them have it. A prime example of a striker is the Commando or the HunchbackIIC. The next class is the brawlers. This is a fun class to play. You should choose a heavy mech with a ton of short range punch. You need to walk up to the enemy and kill them. Simple. You will last longer than a striker. A good mech is the Cataphract or the Marauder with dual LBX's.
       The next two classes, sniper and missile boat, are similar. Snipers need AC-2 and PPC's. Missile boats need LRM-20's. There job is to stay behind the front lines and at long range waiting for scouts to give them targets. Any weight class will do. Awesomes and Catapults are good ways to go. The last class and my personal favorite is the assault class. Your job is to take your ship load of armor and firepower and be a meatshield and heavy gunboat. An amazing mech is the Atlas.</p>
