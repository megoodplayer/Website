         <h1>Battletech and Mechwarrior Tips</h1>

 <p>Welcome to my website! This website has tips and tricks for my favorite game, Battletech, and its splinter game Mechwarrior.</p>
      <h2>Mechwarrior Tips</h2> 
      <img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_kubrick/mig/6/6/1/4/2236614-gsm_169_MechWarriorOnline_LaunchTrailer_091713_320.jpg"/>
      
      <p> The first step to being good at mechwarrior is to select the perfect mech. There are about 400 different mechs so I have to seperate them into classes.
       The first class is scout. You should pick a fast, small light mech perferably with TAG or NARC and ECM. Your job is to run around the flanks and harass and spot enemies for missile strikes. Shoot them with a NARC and TAG and use your ECM to stay alive. A good example is the locust with any variant.
       The second class is striker. These are more armored and slower. You should pick a medium or light mech with punch. Your job is to run up to enemy mechs lighter than you and let them have it. A prime example of a striker is the Commando or the HunchbackIIC. The next class is the brawlers. This is a fun class to play. You should choose a heavy mech with a ton of short range punch. You need to walk up to the enemy and kill them. Simple. You will last longer than a striker. A good mech is the Cataphract or the Marauder with dual LBX's.
       The next two classes, sniper and missile boat, are similar. Snipers need AC-2 and PPC's. Missile boats need LRM-20's. There job is to stay behind the front lines and at long range waiting for scouts to give them targets. Any weight class will do. Awesomes and Catapults are good ways to go. The last class and my personal favorite is the assault class. Your job is to take your ship load of armor and firepower and be a meatshield and heavy gunboat. An amazing mech is the Atlas.</p>

           <h2> Battletech Tips </h2>
      <p> Believe it or not battletech is even more complex than mechwarrior. With millions of mechs and maps and variants I can barely scratch the surface of this game. I will elaborate more in the correct sections. The first tip is to choose your forces wisely. The second is to place them wisely. Then I will teach you how to use your force.</p>
      <h3> Choosing Your Force </h3>
      <p> This might be the hardest part as you cannot change it once you begin. Most battles will have either a battle value or a tonnage value. With both there are two ways to go. You can go with lots of cheap mechs, or a few expensive mechs. It all depends on how you want to play. If you are on the defensive you will want expensive mechs. If you are agressive you can do cheaper mechs. Cheaper mechs should work together against heavier targets. More expensive mechs can work alone. You should also pay attention to mech classes. (see above)</p>
      <h3> Placing Mechs </h3> 
      <p> You can't really gain any advantage from this besides placing your lighter mechs in the open so they can run.
      <h3> Using what you have </h3>
      <p> This is the most important. You need to learn the strengths and weaknesses of your mechs. You should also learn to exploit your opponent's weaknesses. I won't even try to create a list of mechs because that would be a lifelong project.
